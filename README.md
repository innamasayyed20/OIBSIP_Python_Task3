# OIBSIP_Python_Task3 – Simple Password Generator

## 📌 Objective
To develop a simple and secure Password Generator using Python that generates strong random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length and character types.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Random module  
- String module  
- Tkinter (for GUI, if applicable)  

## ⚙️ Features Implemented
- Generates strong and random passwords
- User input for password length
- Option to include:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- One-click password generation
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality (if implemented)
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## 🧩 Steps Performed
1. Designed the user interface (CLI or GUI).
2. Took user input for password length and preferences.
3. Implemented random password generation logic.
4. Ensured inclusion of selected character types.
5. Displayed the generated password securely.
6. Tested the generator with different inputs.

## 🔐 Password Generation Logic
The password is generated using Python’s `random` and `string` modules to randomly select characters from a combined character set based on user preferences.

## ✅ Outcome
A functional password generator that helps users create strong and secure passwords quickly and efficiently.
- User input handling
- Designing simple security-focused applications
